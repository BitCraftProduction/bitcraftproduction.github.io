## People Also Ask (FAQs)

### 1. **What is the SI unit of amount of substance?**  
The SI unit for the amount of substance is the **mole (mol)**. One mole equals \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) particles — known as Avogadro’s number.

### 2. **Why are SI units important in chemistry?**  
SI units create consistency. They help scientists across the world **share, reproduce, and verify** chemical data and experiments without confusion.

### 3. **What is the SI unit of temperature in chemistry?**  
The SI unit of temperature is **kelvin (K)**. It’s used in thermodynamic calculations, unlike Celsius or Fahrenheit.

### 4. **What is the SI unit of concentration?**  
It is **moles per cubic meter (mol/m³)**. In practice, **moles per liter (mol/L)** is often used for convenience.

### 5. **Is liter an SI unit?**  
No. **Liter (L)** is a non-SI unit but widely used. The official SI unit for volume is **cubic meter (m³)**.
