**AI Made Me 10x More Productive—Until It Made Me Lazy**

Let me just say it: **AI is the best damn thing that ever happened to my productivity—and the worst thing that ever happened to my discipline**.

Yep, you read that right. I’m all for automation and efficiency, but there’s a dark side no one warned me about when I started letting AI take the wheel. In the beginning, it was like having a personal assistant who was smarter than me—speeding up my work, making me feel like a productivity superhero. But before I knew it, I found myself relying on AI for everything. The result? I became lazier and more mentally passive than I’d ever been.

There’s no neutral stance here. **I went from 10x productive to 10x lazy**—and I’m not proud of it. What started as a productivity boost turned into a crutch. Now, I’m here to share why that happened, the lessons I learned, and what you can do to avoid the same fate.

This isn’t a love letter. It’s a cautionary tale—and it might just change the way you use AI forever.


### Chapter 1: The Glorious High—AI as My Superpower

When GPT-3 dropped, I was frothing at the keyboard. Suddenly, I could brainstorm 50 blog titles in 5 minutes. Summarize books I hadn’t read. Reply to emails with the eloquence of a Victorian gentleman on Adderall. I felt like Tony Stark if JARVIS also knew marketing.

*“I’m 10x-ing everything!”* I told my friends, smugly sipping my oat milk latte while ChatGPT wrote my newsletter in the background. I was learning faster, writing more, even meditating more efficiently (with AI-generated mantras, because of course).

For a while, it was bliss. My to-do list looked like a graveyard of crushed goals.

  

### Chapter 2: The Quiet Slump—Productive but Pointless

But then… something weird happened.

I stopped thinking.

No, seriously. I stopped solving problems. I just *delegated* them. Got a tricky coding error? Paste it into ChatGPT. Need a new business idea? Ask Claude. Not sure what to eat? Ask Gemini for a “nutritionally balanced meal plan for people who hate cooking and joy.”

At some point, I realized I hadn’t *struggled* with anything in weeks. And it hit me:
**AI made me productive, but it also made me intellectually soft.**

  

### Chapter 3: The Wake-Up Call (Aka The Embarrassing Moment I’m Still Cringing About)

I was invited to speak on a panel about AI in creative workflows. Naturally, I asked ChatGPT to write my script. (Meta, I know.)

Fast-forward to the event. Someone asks:
*“Can you walk us through the logic of how you trained your summarization tool?”*

I blanked.
Like, full deer-in-headlights. I’d literally copied and pasted someone else’s Python pipeline a month ago and told myself I’d “come back and learn it later.”

Spoiler: I didn’t.

I mumbled something about “transformer architecture” and “neural vibes.” I sounded like an undergrad trying to bullshit a PhD defense with Wikipedia quotes.

  

### Chapter 4: The Lazy Loop

Here’s the trap no one talks about:
**AI doesn’t just automate tasks—it automates your curiosity if you’re not careful.**

When everything feels “solvable” by typing a few words into a prompt box, your brain stops craving depth. You start chasing output over understanding.

I got lazy. Not in the lying-on-the-couch sense. I was *busy*. But mentally? Intellectually? I was phoning it in with auto-complete.

  

### Chapter 5: What I Do Now (To Stay Smart *and* Productive)

I still use AI—hell yes I do. But with guardrails. Here's what I’ve changed:

1. **Manual First, AI Later**: I try solving problems *before* asking the machine. If I get stuck for 20+ minutes, then I’ll prompt. It keeps my problem-solving muscles alive.

2. **‘Explain It Back’ Rule**: Anything AI gives me—code, content, strategy—I force myself to *re-explain it in my own words*, out loud. If I can’t, I don’t use it.

3. **Creative Time = No AI Time**: 1 hour every day where I write, draw, think, or build *without* any AI assistance. It's like brushing my teeth, but for my soul.

4. **Shame-Based Learning**: I keep a “Didn’t Know Sh\*t” journal. Every time I blank in a meeting or fake expertise, it goes in there. Nothing motivates growth like spicy humiliation.

### Final Thought: Don’t Let the Robot Steal Your Brain

Yes, AI is magic. It *can* make you a productivity god. But if you're not intentional, you'll become a glorified prompt monkey with no original thought and a slowly atrophying brain.

Let AI be your tool—not your crutch.
Or as I tell myself now:

> “Use AI like a sword, not a damn wheelchair.”

  

### What You Should Try

* Go *one day a week* without using any AI. Just to feel your own thoughts again.
* Build something stupid *without Googling anything*. See how far you get.
* Every time you ask AI for help, ask yourself afterward: *Did I actually learn anything?*

That’s it. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to fix a script I don't understand that AI wrote for me. Again.
