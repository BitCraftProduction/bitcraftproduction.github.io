   - **Systems of Equations (Substitution or Elimination):**
     - For substitution: Solve one equation for one variable and substitute it into the other.
     - For elimination: Add or subtract equations to eliminate one variable.

     ax^2 + bx + c = a(x - r)(x - s)
     \]

### Why These Formulas Matter

What I love about these formulas is that they not only help solve problems but also teach us how the world worksâ€”whether itâ€™s calculating the area of a circle or understanding the behavior of curves in calculus. They simplify complex ideas and make math a lot more approachable.

I encourage you to play around with these formulas, experiment, and see how they work in different scenarios. With a bit of practice, they can become second nature, and the next time you're solving a problem, you'll be more confident.

## Conclusion

I hope this guide helps you master ACT math and feel more comfortable with math. Remember, practice is key, so keep working on these formulas and try to apply them in real-world scenarios. With time, you'll find that these formulas become second nature, and you'll be able to solve problems with ease.
