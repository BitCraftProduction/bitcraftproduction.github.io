  - question: "How do you know if a table shows a linear function?"
    answer: "Check if the change in y is always the same when x changes by the same amount."
  - question: "What is a constant rate of change?"
    answer: "It means y changes by the same amount every time x increases by a fixed number."
  - question: "Can a table with unequal x values still be linear?"
    answer: "Yes, as long as the rate of change (Î”y/Î”x) stays the same."
  - question: "What does a nonlinear table look like?"
    answer: "The changes in y are not consistent. For example: +1, +3, +7, +13."
  - question: "What if y is always the same?"
    answer: "Thatâ€™s still linear. Itâ€™s called a horizontal line (slope = 0)."

Have you ever looked at a table of numbers and wondered,  
**"Is this a linear function?"**
Letâ€™s break it down in a simple way.  
With easy rules.  
And quick examples.

## What is a Linear Function?

A **linear function** is a rule that creates a **straight line** when you graph it.  
It follows the form:

```
y = mx + b
```

- `m` is the **slope** (the rate of change)  
- `b` is the **y-intercept**

## How to Tell from a Table

To find out if a table shows a linear function, use this rule:

> **Check if the change in y is always the same when x changes by the same amount.**

This is called a **constant rate of change**.

### Letâ€™s Try an Example

Hereâ€™s a table:

| x | y  |
|---|----|
| 1 | 3  |
| 2 | 5  |
| 3 | 7  |
| 4 | 9  |

Letâ€™s check:

- From x=1 to x=2 â†’ y goes from 3 to 5 â†’ change is **+2**  
- From x=2 to x=3 â†’ y goes from 5 to 7 â†’ change is **+2**  
- From x=3 to x=4 â†’ y goes from 7 to 9 â†’ change is **+2**


âœ… The change in y is always **+2**  
So, this table **represents a linear function**.

### Another Example: Is This Linear?

Letâ€™s look at this new table:

| x | y  |
|---|----|
| 2 | 6  |
| 4 | 10 |
| 6 | 14 |
| 8 | 18 |

Letâ€™s check the changes step by step.

#### Step 1: Change in x  
- From 2 â†’ 4 â†’ 6 â†’ 8  
- Change in x is **+2** every time.

#### Step 2: Change in y  
- From 6 â†’ 10 â†’ 14 â†’ 18  
- Change in y is **+4** every time.

Now check:

> Change in y Ã· change in x = 4 Ã· 2 = **2**

Since the ratio is the same every time,  
âœ… this table **represents a linear function**.


---

### A Non-Example (Not Linear)

| x | y  |
|---|----|
| 1 | 2  |
| 2 | 4  |
| 3 | 8  |
| 4 | 16 |

Check the y changes:

- +2 â†’ +4 â†’ +8 â†’ itâ€™s **not the same**

This is **not a linear function**  
Itâ€™s probably an **exponential function**.

---

## Quick Trick to Remember

> If the difference in y is always the same,  
> and the difference in x is also the same,  
> âœ… it's linear!

## Quick Test: Which Table is Linear?

Here are two tables.  
Which one is linear?

#### Table A:

| x | y  |
|---|----|
| 1 | 5  |
| 2 | 8  |
| 3 | 11 |
| 4 | 14 |

#### Table B:

| x | y  |
|---|----|
| 1 | 1  |
| 2 | 4  |
| 3 | 9  |
| 4 | 16 |

**Answer: Table A is linear**  
Because y increases by **+3** each time.
Now, find the answer for table B.

---

### Summary

- A **linear function** has a **constant rate of change**  
- Check if y changes evenly when x increases evenly  
- Use this to spot **linear tables easily**

## FAQ: Linear Function from a Table

#### **1. How do you know if a table shows a linear function?**  
Check if the change in y is always the same when x changes by the same amount.
<br>

#### **2. What is a constant rate of change?**  
A constant rate of change means y changes by the same amount every time x increases by a fixed number.
<br>

#### **3. Can a table with unequal x values still be linear?**  
Yes, as long as the **rate of change (Î”y/Î”x)** stays the same.
<br>

#### **4. What does a nonlinear table look like?**  
The changes in y are not consistent. For example: +1, +3, +7, +13.
<br>

#### **5. What if y is always the same?**  
Thatâ€™s still linear! Itâ€™s called a **horizontal line** (slope = 0).
