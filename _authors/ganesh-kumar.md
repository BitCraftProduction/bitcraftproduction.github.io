Hi there! I’m **Ganesh Kumar**, and you can call me an indie developer. I’m addicted to learning and building something new from scratch. That’s why I created **BitCraft Production** — a place to showcase my products, tools, and ideas with the world. I have big plans for BitCraft Production: developing products that make people's lives easier and more fun.

I design and build purposeful digital experiences — from productivity tools to creative games, and even open-source projects (though I haven’t launched any open-source projects yet, but I’m working on it).

My mission is simple: **Have fun and spread fun**. Sounds crazy, right? But I believe that digital tools are meant to make life easier, and since they’re not as essential as food, shelter, or education, they should be *fun* to use.
